# tankGame
(SCHOOL PROJECT) The premise of the game is a PVP and PVE hybrid where player tanks can choose to kill either the enemy tank or go directly to the second player to win the PVP fight. Each enemy has a chance to drop perks that can increase the player's stats which can give one player advantage over the other.
